    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <div class="list">
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 450Â°F (or the temperature specified on your pizza crust package).</li>
            <li>Place your pizza crust on a baking sheet or pizza stone.</li>
            <li>Spread a layer of tomato sauce evenly over the pizza crust, leaving about 1/2 inch of space around the edges for the crust to expand.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the tomato sauce, again leaving some space around the edges.</li>
            <li>Add your desired toppings to the pizza. Be sure not to overload the pizza with too many toppings, as this can make it difficult to cook properly.</li>
            <li>Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the crust is golden brown</li>
            <li>Once the pizza is finished baking, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
        </ol>
